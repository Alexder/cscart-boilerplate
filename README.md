# The CS-Cart Boilerplate Theme
### A CS-Cart theme based on HTML5 Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.5

Hello from the CS-Cart team!
Developing new themes from the built-in CS-Cart Responsive theme takes much time and effort—a developer has to completely rework the Responsive theme by deleting tons of code.
We’d like to ease the work for theme developers, so we’re presenting to you a special Boilerplate theme that has minimum of code and is easy to develop.
Read our [detailed blog post](http://blog.cs-cart.com/2015/12/25/cs-cart-boilerplate-theme-minimum-of-code-maximum-of-flexibility/) to learn about all the features of the new CS-Cart Boilerplate theme.
